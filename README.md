#### Sales Trends:

- January 2018 marked the company’s best performance, with 10,640 orders generating ₹43M in monthly revenue. However, sales dropped significantly in 2020 as the pandemic shifted customer behavior and disrupted the online food delivery market.
- Despite a decline in revenue toward October 2018, the company managed to maintain order volume at around 10,000 orders, showing strong customer retention. But from January to December 2019, both orders and revenue consistently decreased orders dropped by 14% and revenue declined by 18%.
- June 2020 recorded the lowest revenue and order volume in the company’s history, and the entire year of 2020 remained weak due to nationwide COVID-19 lockdowns and restricted movement.
- The downward trend that began in August 2019 continued through June 2020. Prior to August 2019, revenue had already started to decline, but order volume remained fairly stable, indicating early signs of customer value drop despite steady demand.

#### Regional Comparsions:

- The bar chart represents the top 5 cities ranked by revenue.
- Tirupati clearly dominates in revenue. Although Bangalore has a higher number of restaurants than Tirupati, it still does not generate comparable revenue.
- Other cities generate significantly lower revenue compared to the top-performing cities. In both 2018 and 2019, Tirupati leads in revenue despite having fewer restaurants, likely due to its strong tourism-driven demand in Andhra Pradesh.
- Bareilly and Sultanpur, both located in Uttar Pradesh, ranked as the top cities in 2017 and 2020. Among these two, Bareilly has a higher restaurant count compared to Sultanpur.

# Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:

- Students and employees place the highest number of orders (160k and 92k respectively). Orders from self-employed customers and housewives are significantly lower. To attract more orders from housewives, Swiggy can introduce “Women’s Special” offers, such as a 25% discount on orders above ₹1,000.
- eekly order trends show strong activity on Saturdays and Sundays, with many orders both below and above ₹1,000. Activating the “Women’s Special Weekend Offer” specifically on Saturdays and Sundays can help increase weekend sales and boost engagement from housewives.
-A majority of Swiggy restaurants have 4-star ratings. Swiggy should collect feedback from frequent customers and share insights with restaurants rated below 4 stars. This will help improve service quality and reduce customer and restaurant churn.
- Swiggy should continue strengthening its loyalty program to convert non-customers into active customers. Offering one-time sign-up rewards, discounts on the first three orders, and exclusive weekend deals for existing customers can increase retention and ensure long-term loyalty.
